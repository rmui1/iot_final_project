Garlic has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. If you really want to get the most health benefits out of your garlic, choose Spanish garlic, which contains the most allicin (one of garlic's most beneficial compounds)."],"price":[],"cooking":["Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.","Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature

Garlic has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. If you really want to get the most health benefits out of your garlic, choose Spanish garlic, which contains the most allicin (one of garlic's most beneficial compounds).","Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."],"price":["Most dairy products stay good well past their sell-by date. Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny. Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money)."],"cooking":["Store potatoes and sweet potatoes in a cool, dark place, and never put them in the refrigerator. At cold temperatures, the starch in potatoes is turned into sugar, affecting their flavor. For more information about selecting and storing potatoes, check out <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/potatoes\">this lesson about potatoes</a> in the academy.","If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.","You should not store your onions with your potatoes because the gases they emit will make each other spoil faster. For more information about selecting and storing onions, check out <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/onions\">this lesson about onions</a> in the academy.","To keep your eyes from stinging and watering while cutting onions, trying popping the onion in the freezer for 15 minutes before you plan to start cooking. Chilling the onion slows the release of the enzyme responsible for teary eyes.","Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit.

Garlic has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties.

Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny.

In case you're wondering what the difference between capers and caper berries is, capers are flower buds, while caper berries are the product of the same flower buds being allowed to mature and produce fruits (i.e. the caper berries!) Most sources say the two are not interchangeable, as they differ in both size and flavor.","To keep your eyes from stinging and watering while cutting onions, trying popping the onion in the freezer for 15 minutes before you plan to start cooking. Chilling the onion slows the release of the enzyme responsible for teary eyes.","Just a head's up: tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated! They will lose their flavor and probably get mushy too. For more on selecting and storing tomatoes and other vegetables, check out the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy#Ingredients\">academy</a>.","Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.","The average fresh lemon contains between 2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice (just in case you are substituting bottled lemon juice).","If parmesan plays a big role in the flavor of your dish (or if you're a serious foodie or serious about avoiding additivies) it might be worth your time to track down <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/larryolmsted/2012/11/19/the-dark-side-of-parmesan-cheese-what-you-dont-know-might-hurt-you\">\"true\" parmesan</a>, Parmigiano Reggiano.","Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.","The best method for cooking pasta is pretty controversial, but most sources seem to reach a consensus.

While this is true and definitely worth considering, you should be aware that all bread (especially your typical supermarket loaves) will raise your <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htm\">blood sugar</a> and should be eaten in moderation.","There are a bunch of great condiments you can use on a sandwich or wrap instead of mayo, such as avocado, hummus, mustard, olive oil and vinegar, etc. If you're looking to make a healthier sandwich, try using one of these healthier substitutes or at least limit yourself to one tablespoon of high-quality mayo.","Lycopene, the chemical in tomatoes that makes them red (and healthy), is fat soluble. This means eating tomatoes with a <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/fat\">fat</a> &mdash; say, avocado or olive oil?improves the body's ability to absorb the lycopene. Don't hesitate to include some healthy fats in this dish to get the most health benefits from the tomatoes!","You can use yogurt instead of mayonnaise to salads more protein rich and less heavy.","Since most of its calories come from fat, sour cream has a bad reputation for being an unhealthy food. However, <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/fat\">fat</a> is an important part of the diet and studies suggest people who eat full fat dairy <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/02/12/275376259/the-full-fat-paradox-whole-milk-may-keep-us-lean\">are thinner</a> than those who reach for reduced fat products. That said, fat has more calories per gram than carbohydrates or protein, so if you are counting calories to lose weight, you might want to try substituting greek yogurt for some of the sour cream in recipes that call for a lot of it.","You can use yogurt instead of mayonnaise to make dips, sauces, and spreads that are rich in protein and less heavy.","If you're following a gluten-free diet, make sure your bread (and all other ingredients) is truly gluten free."],"price":["Fresh herbs can be expensive, so don't let them go to waste. If you have any leftovers, you might be able to freeze them. The Kitchn recommends <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/freeze-herbs-in-olive-oil-173648\">freezing hardy herbs</a> like rosemary and thyme in olive oil, while Better Homes and Gardens suggests using <a href=\"http://www.bhg.com/recipes/how-to/food-storage-safety/freezing-herbs/\">freezer bags</a> to freeze basil, chives, mint, and more.","Most dairy products stay good well past their sell-by date. Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny. Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money)."],"cooking":["You do not have to remove the seeds from a cucumber. In fact, the seeds are probably the most nutritious part! As for the skin, you should probably peel cucumbers (unless you like the skin and know the cucumber has not been waxed).","To prevent curdling, take sour cream of the fridge well in advance and only add it to hot soups or sauces once it has reached room temperature and once the soup/sauce has cooled down a bit.","To get perfect hard-boiled eggs, start by storing the eggs with the <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/tip-perfect-hardboiled-eggs-47197\">tip of the egg</a> pointing down. This will help center the yolk. Once it is time to make the eggs, put the eggs in a pot with cold water and bring it to a boil. Once you have a rolling boil, remove the pot from the heat and cover with a lid. After 12 minutes, drain the pot and rinse the eggs in cold water. To peel, crack the egg shell on all sides and  roll it with your hand to thoroughly break up the shell.","Just a head's up: tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated! They will lose their flavor and probably get mushy too. For more on selecting and storing tomatoes and other vegetables, check out the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy#Ingredients\">academy</a>.","The average fresh lemon contains between 2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice (just in case you are substituting bottled lemon juice).","Fresh herbs should be added toward the end of the cooking process &mdash; even at the very last minute?especially delicate herbs like cilantro, basil, and dill. Hardier herbs like bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme can be added earlier.","Don't have fresh herbs? Substitute dried herbs, but use about 1/3 less because dried herbs are more potent than fresh.  ","Confused by the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/cream\">different types of cream</a> &mdash; Most differences arise from the fat content of the cream, and whether or not the cream has been \"soured\" by adding lactic acid bacteria to give it a tangy flavor."],"green":["Tomatoes, especially cherry tomatoes, should be bought <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php\">organic</a> when possible. Moreover, buying tomatoes from your <a href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/farmers-markets/\">local farmers' market</a> when they are in season is going to make your dish much, much tastier, not to mention more eco-friendly. In fact, we recommend using canned &mdash; or better yet, jarred?tomato products when tomatoes aren't in season instead of buying imported or greenhouse-grown tomatoes."]},"openLicense":2,"suspiciousDataScore":0.0,"approved":2,"unknownIngredients":[],"userTags":[],"originalId":null,"spoonacularScore":49.09416580200195,"spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/tuna-sandwich-savory-cake-swedish-smoergstrta-1095945"}]
